" To use it, copy it to
"     for Unix and OS/2:  ~/.vimrc
"  for MS-DOS and Win32:  $VIM\_vimrc

"  If you don't understand a setting in here, just type ':h setting'.

" Use Vim settings, rather than Vi settings (much better!).
" This must be first, because it changes other options as a side effect.

"$HOME/.vim and $HOME/.vim/after are in the &rtp on unix
"But on windows, they need to be added.
if has("win16") || has("win32") || has("win64")
  "add g:my_vim_dir to the front of the runtimepath
   execute "set rtp^=".g:my_vim_dir
  "add g:my_vim_dir\after to the end of the runtimepath
  execute "set rtp+=".g:my_vim_dir."\\after"
  "Note, pathogen#infect() looks for the 'bundle' folder in each path
  "of the &rtp, where the last dir in the '&rtp path' is not 'after'. The
  "<path>\bundle\*\after folders will be added if and only if
  "the corresponding <path>\after folder is in the &rtp before
  "pathogen#infect() is called.  So it is very important to add the above
  "'after' folder.
  "(This applies to vim plugins such as snipmate, tabularize, etc.. that
  " are loaded by pathogen (and perhaps vundle too.))

  " Not necessary, but I like to cleanup &rtp to use \ instead of /
